    "## Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a programmable crpyotcurrency with the following points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike blockchain technology, In Olal, Each account (private public key) has its own books. A receiving ledger book for recording incoming receiving transactions, and a spending ledger for recording spending transactions.\n",
    "  - Choose the right choice of storage (sqlite3 or virtual file system etc) for storing each acount's key data and ledger books data.\n",
    "- Transactions in a book is like stack, it can only grow. A transaction happens in the following stages:\n",
    "  - Sender account initiates a spending transaction from its own spending book (that contains the current total number of transaction of its own recieving and spending ledger) by populating this signed transaction to the entire Olal network (regardless of the transport of connecion, could be websocket through server relay, could be peer to peer connection through similar miniupnpc like bitcoin, or through WebRTC and tunnnelling server). \n",
    "  - This sender account's initiation logic is determined by the smart contract written for the receiving account address. The smart contract written in lua will be run by all nodes. This contract code might be run by the sender to initiate a trasnaction, and it also run the the receiving account's node to finalize/confirming the transaction, and it also run by all other nodes on the network to lock ledger states for preventing double spending, or any other logic receiving account impose own its own ledger books."

    "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantum-Resistant Key Support:\n",
    "   1. Implementation: Consider integrating a quantum-resistant algorithm like Dilithium. The liboqs library provides implementations of such algorithms.\n",
    "   2. KeyPair Interface: Extend the KeyPair interface to accommodate additional key types, ensuring methods like sign and verify are appropriately implemented for each algorithm.​\n",
    "2. Delegate Key Management:\n",
    "   1. Identification: Implement a method to retrieve delegate keys by their public key or identifier, facilitating management and verification processes.\n",
    "   2. Revocation: Introduce functionality to revoke or replace delegate keys, enhancing security and flexibility.​\n",
    "3. Transaction Verification:\n",
    "   1. Delegate Verification: In the Account class, implement a method to verify if a transaction was signed by a valid delegate key. This ensures that only authorized delegate keys can sign receiving transactions.​\n",
    "4. Serialization and Deserialization:\n",
    "   1. Consistency: Ensure that both Account and Transaction classes have robust serialization and deserialization methods. This is crucial for network communication and storage.​\n",
    "5. Unit Testing:\n",
    "   1. Coverage: Develop comprehensive unit tests for key functionalities, including key generation, signing, verification, transaction creation, and ledger updates.\n",
    "   2. Edge Cases: Test scenarios involving invalid signatures, unauthorized delegate keys, and malformed transactions to ensure system robustness.​\n",
    "6. Documentation:\n",
    "   1. Usage Examples: Provide examples demonstrating how to create accounts, add delegate keys, create transactions, and verify signatures. This aids in onboarding and understanding the system's capabilities."

Receiver also tries to get this __pending__ transaction from as many nodes as possible in the network and verify that there's no two or more different __pending__ transactions on the network from the same sender.
